The Singapore Airlines Suite Class Experience

I've always been happy flying economy, because despite the cramped space, I could just cozy up with a book, a movie, perhaps some wine on a full-service flight, and sleep like a baby. I knew that it was a temporary discomfort because after a few hours, I'd be in my destination with all the space I can explore (sometimes, too much space on those times when you do a lot of walking).

A few years ago, I went on my first business class flight, which felt a little intimidating, like I was an imposter since I was so comfortable in economy. I had this nagging feeling that it was an unnecessary expense to get upgraded. I'd much rather spend the extra money on food or shopping. ![The Private Room at Singapore Airlines Lounge](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b2b75da4-2534-4935-b673-f8f6b2135bff.jpg)

As for first class, that's always been a dream, a dream I am working towards as I build my design business and live a life without borders. I envision myself and my husband sailing the world, staying exotic locations, where I design and write at this quaint cafe with foreign voices around me, while I work away, not worrying that we're not making the most out of our 5-week holiday. Because this holiday could be as long as we want!

So that's the dream. I felt that the day I fly first class, I would have made it.

That milestone, however, needs to be reconsidered, because a few months ago, my husband surprised me with a birthday trip to New York, with Suite Class tickets on Singapore Airlines! 

What's Suite Class, you might say? That's exactly what I asked him until my husband explained to me that Suite Class, my dearest, is the class above first. And yes, it turns out that there's one better than first. In my geeky mind, the one that precedes one is zero, but in this case, it's called Suites. 

I would have loved to give you a comparison of First Class and Suite Class, but since I've never been on a first class seat, it's probably best that I highlight the differences that I do know about:

1. Ever wonder why you rarely see superstars (at least those without private jets) checking in with you at the airport? I did. So it turns out that they have this not so super-secret but uber exclusive check-in desk. It was a massive space, with five staff and there were only two of us checking in. Granted, we were early because we wanted to make the most out of the experience.
2. We also went through our very own immigration desk. They also offer to escort you if you need.
3. We got shown to The Private Room at the Singapore Airlines Lounge. On we walked, past the Business Class Lounge, then past the First Class Lounge, then finally to this luxuriously furnished space with brown and tan marble, red velvet, and leather lounges. It had its own dining room where you can order lobster and champagne, as much food and drink as you like. (I realised then that I should have held off on the chicken rice rampage that we've done in the past 24 hours in Singapore.)
4. We were amongst the first to board the plane, given our choice of Krug vs Dom Perignon (the same champagnes we carefully picked for our wedding), warm nuts to munch on, a selection of newspapers and magazines, and a 23-inch LCD screen and a pair of $400 Bose noise-cancelling headphones.
5. We were served a 3-4 course meal (which we have booked in advance via the Book The Cook service), where we had lobster, caviar, suckling pig, sea bass.
6. From Singapore to Germany, we drank 2 bottles of champagne between the two of us (a very safe estimate), and for me, at least five cups of exquisite Blue Mountain coffee. It was a bit curious that when I asked for chocolate, I got a bar of Kitkat, which was almost sacrilege to have with Blue Mountain. Maybe this is a good time for Pana Chocolage to sweeten the deal? ;)
7. The service and silver were faultless and the china? Wedgwood for Singapore Airlines.
8. We were given a set of good-quality designer pyjamas, blankets that I suspect were made of wool because they're slightly itchy, and a toiletry set by Ferragamo that includes a lip balm (which curiously tasted like lotion, that I wondered if they made a mistake with the packaging or if that's just me not being used to anything other than good old glycerin-based lip balm?), and a 30ml bottle of fragrance. (D'oh, rookie mistake, I had brought a 50ml bottle perfume with me.)
9. The leather seats were almost as soft as lambskin, with room to have a guest sit across from you in your very own suite, with a sliding door and blinds for privacy.
10. And the most impressive thing yet: they turned my husband's adjacent suite and mine into a double-bed suite.

And the price tag for the above? A whopping AUD$13000 for a return flight. Luckily, we didn't pay that much. In fact, we only paid for the taxes and fees. It was largely the result of strategically earning airline miles with our credit cards, over five years.

If you're wondering how we scored these tickets, I'm revealing our strategy on how to maximise your airline miles earnings on my next post.
