Right now, I am:

* living in the world's most liveable city (Melbourne) with the world's most amazing husband ;-)
* working on [digital design projects][0] that help entrepreneurs and creatives change lives and the world
* volunteering as a fashion coordinator at Moral Fairground, to advocate sustainable fashion and fair trade 

This page is inspired by the [Nownownow.com][1] project by Derek Sivers.
