## [AeroPress Aeropress Coffee and Espresso Maker][0][AVAILABLE AT AMAZON ][0]Having lived in Melbourne and spoilt for coffee choices, I was surprised that in New York in 2012 and realised that the best place I could get decent coffee was Starbucks. After doing my research, I found a few places but they were over 5 blocks away from where I was staying (midtown Manhattan). This led me to realise that I needed a coffee kit. Enter Aeropress. It goes in my suitcase everywhere I go. Most coffee lovers that try it from my kit are quite impressed and end up buying one![The Way of Qigong: The Art and Science of Chinese Energy Healing][1][AVAILABLE AT AMAZON ][1]I used to do yoga but I hated having to take a yoga mat with me, much less use my yoga mat on unknown surfaces (I'm OCD like that). Enter my mother-in-law who introduced Qigong. It's yoga principles and more, without needing a mat![AmazonBasics Micro USB to Lightning Adapter (Apple Certified)][2]Ever had your lightning cable break a number of times because you like to use your phone while it's charging, and that constant strain on the delicate part of the cable near the connector just causes it to break? The lightning cables are not cheap, but micro-USB cables are. Thank goodness someone thought about making the adapter. It's a bit longer-lasting. I've had mine for half a year (longer than my first cable lasted); I think this is a keeper.I just recently bought this after my S-filter filter broke! I think it's the more sustainable way to go, and you don't have to worry about running out of paper filters.[Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micelle Solution 250ml][3]Great for removing makeup and to cleanse your face while travelling --- no need for soap or water, just some cotton pads or a cloth will do! Tip: clean your face until the pad/cloth is clean. Wish I knew about this product when I was a teenager. I think it would have saved me from all that acne. Ugh.[Eco Feminine Pack][4][AVAILABLE AT FREEDOM PRODUCTS - JUJU CUP ][4]After hours of research into the most eco-friendly feminine product packs, here is the pack you'll only ever need. Eco-friendly and easy to pack, you get some great gluten-free chocolate in it too! It's a win-win. :)[KEF M500 Hi-Fi On-Ear Headphones - Aluminum/Black][5]Great noise-cancelling so you can drown out the engine noise and watch onboard entertainment in peace. Much better than the usual economy headsets that you get.[Alexander McQueen Square Scarf Floral Skulls Buttercups Bees Silk][6][AVAILABLE AT AMAZON ][6]A versatile scarf to keep you warm and cozy from the temperature changes.[Ray-Ban Aviator Non-Polarized Sunglasses RB3025, Gold Frame/Green Lens][7][AVAILABLE AT AMAZON ][7]Classic aviators that says..."effortless".[evian EVIAN Min Water Facial Spray Trio][8][AVAILABLE AT AMAZON ][8]This helps keep your skin fresh and hydrated especially when you have limited access to toilet facilities while traveling.[Isabel Marant Women's Dicker Suede Cowboy Ankle Boots Vintage Black][9][AVAILABLE AT AMAZON ][9]My favourite pair of shoes for travel. Incredibly versatile, they go with everything (jeans, shorts, skirts) and are amazingly comfortable at its medium heel height.[First Botany Cosmeceuticals Australian Tea Tree Oil, 4 fl. oz. with Glass Dropper][10]A natural antiseptic, you can use tea tree oil for just about anything. I always take a small bottle with me. Great for mosquito/insect bites, spot treatment (pimples), and also doubles up as a hand sanitiser and mouthwash (just add a few drops in water---don't swallow, because it's pretty potent and toxic if ingested).
