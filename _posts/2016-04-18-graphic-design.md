# Graphic Design

## Canva

Everybody knows Canva. It's great for quick graphics and inspiration. With Canva for work, you get the convenience of having consistent visuals. But if you prefer to use it for free, check out Design Feed (a tool I've classified under social media due to its main purpose of providing ease for generating social media graphics).

## Sketch by Bohemian Coding

Used and designed for UI/UX designers, this Mac-only app makes the workflow so much better. At a fraction of the price and learning curve for Adobe Illustrator, it is one of my favourite tools around.

# Typesetting, Book Design & eBooks

## Pages

If Adobe InDesign scares the heck out of you, Pages is a viable alternative. You can even transform your work into ePub as necessary.

## Google Slides

After a recent makeover, Google has some very modern and delectable templates that you can use for slides and even PDF eBooks.

# Typography

## [Type Scale][0]

Great resource for choosing typefaces and font styles and sizes.

## [The League of Moveable Type][1]

My go-to resource for beautiful typefaces carefully curated by professional typographers and designers.

# Bonus: Design Essentials/Non-Hacks

## Adobe Illustrator

This is the godfather of all graphic design software. It's a bit of a learning curve but if you want to go pro, you probably need to invest the time to learn it.

## Adobe InDesign

Used by the pros for print formatting and typesetting.
