# Graphic Design

## Canva

Everybody knows Canva. It's great for quick graphics and inspiration.

## Adobe Illustrator

This is the godfather of all graphic design software. It's a bit of a learning curve but if you want to go pro, you probably need to invest the time to learn it.

## Sketch by Bohemian Coding

Used and designed for UI/UX designers, this Mac-only app makes the workflow so much better. At a fraction of the price and learning curve for Adobe Illustrator, it is one of my favourite tools around.

# Typesetting, Book Design & eBooks

## Adobe InDesign

Used by the pros. Don't let that stop you (if a newbie), a few tutorials on Youtube and a few hours of practice should get you started on 

## Pages

If you're not an Adobe InDesign afficionado, Pages is a viable alternative. You can even transform your work into ePub as necessary.

# Typography
