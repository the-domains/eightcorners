> "My favorite definition \[of forgiveness\] is giving up the hope that the past could be any different."--- Oprah

This year, I made a commitment to myself to be more open. So what I am about to write can be raw. Yet I feel like it needs to be said, in case there's someone out there needing to figure out forgiveness.

A few months ago, I was asked to forgive someone who had impacted my life so much that I'd let it rule most of my life.

Since then, I have been questioning what forgiveness really meant, because I thought I had already forgiven. I've moved on with my life and I'm building a new life with carefully-chosen people around me.

It turns out that my definition of forgiveness was different from what others expected. I guess they expected that life would be back to normal. That the relationship can be repaired like nothing had happened, and that things could have a "happy ending".

I've long forgiven my mother for leaving us by accepting the fact that she would never return and reunite with my father. I've learned to accept that it was for the best.

I've long forgiven my stepmother for not loving us like her own, because I've accepted that not many people can love children that are not their own. 

Sometimes happy endings doesn't have to be by being with the same people that hurt you in the first place. Especially if you've already tried a few times to make it work.

Sometimes happy endings just involves you, and the very people who do make you happy.

When you realise this, and you've accepted the past and no longer let it control your future, then you have truly forgiven.
