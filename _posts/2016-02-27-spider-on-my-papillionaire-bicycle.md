# Spiders, brands, and fears ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/87614e52-00a0-42d1-9dde-fe8d10fa1e71.png)

Last weekend, I found a spider taking up residence on my beloved Papi (my Papillionaire bike) that my husband got me one Valentine's Day.

I remember the time I fell in love with the Papillionaire brand of bicycles. Maybe it was because of the fact that I loved butterflies, or how they put so much love into every detail: leather seats, leather handlebars, beautiful colour options. I knew I wanted one.

My husband started looking at other bikes for me that were half the price of the Papillionaire (it was around $500 at the time). There was a well-known brand at half the price, so we went to the shop to have a look.

It was like comparing Mercedes with a Toyota. There was no comparison. The build, the detail, the elegance, was just not there.

Recently, I have had to think a lot about my brand. What is the experience that I want my clients to have? 

Today, as I took out my bike for a ride, I still felt the same love and pride for my bike, albeit a bit dusty with the random cobweb.

I then realise that I want to be a brand like Papillionaire---great ethos and uncompromising quality. (So much so, that I was willing to take up cycling just to have it.) A brand that stands the test of time, which can withstand the occasional spider, and deliver the same feeling as it did the first time.
