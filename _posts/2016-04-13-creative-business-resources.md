# Creative Business Resources

For the past few years, I've realised that for creatives (web designers, graphic designers, photographers, copywriters and writers) is tougher than anything else I've ever attempted in my life.

It's totally different from my life in IT where my work is validated by machines---computers will tell you whether you did the right thing or not.

When you're a creative, it's very subjective that your work may, or may not...work. For your client. Then there's times where you feel like you've lost your mojo and can't come up with a great idea. So you start looking for inspiration on the web, and end up spending hours on Pinterest. You find a design that inspires you, but you feel guilty copying even one aspect of it. (You're not even copying the whole thing, perhaps just the font, but there's still this guilty feeling.) Then you remind yourself of [that quote][0]:

> Good artists copy. Great artists steal.

So you sort of borrow a few things and still doesn't work for you. Maybe in the back of your mind, you know it's not yours. So whoever said that quote must a conscience that has atrophied. ;)

Nevertheless, you push on because you have a deadline. Either self-imposed or project-imposed. So you put on your "Dumb Designer Sally" hat (which helps prevent analysis paralysis), do your best work (still far from perfect---though everyone says it's great), and put it out there.

Then there are days when you just need the extra boost. So you scour the Internet for something that will help you.

After years of scouring, I thought I would share the best ones that I've found, so you don't have to spend too much time searching. 

Without further ado, here are my favourite Internet your business (and mental) health:

# Unf\*ckwithable Girlfriends at The Middle Finger Project

Probably the greatest business resource out there for creatives. Ash Ambirge is a genius at empowering creatives, helping you get through impostor syndrome, how to talk to clients, and much more. I love that it's practical, powerful, and fun. Business doesn't all have to be serious.

While her main blog is a treasure-trove of "humorous business advice", Unf\*ckwithable Girlfriends gets more intimate as Ash mentors you to get over your own demons, how to start a business, and live a good life.

Because it's one crazy rollercoaster ride---you need one heck of a survival kit.
