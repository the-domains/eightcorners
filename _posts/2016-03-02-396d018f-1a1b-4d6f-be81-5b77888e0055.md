# Design Digest: Wk 09

I browse the Internet a lot. Perhaps way too much. Some may say it's unproductive, but is it really unproductive if I find so much cool stuff?! :)

Here are the top finds for the week!

**[Adorable Flat Workspace][0]**- super-cute workspace illustration to brighten up anyone's day! Also a good inspiration for an upcoming project. 

**[Ad Parlor][1]**- for FB Ad design and mockups. 

**[Art Workspace Mockups][2] - **for blogs, headers, etc.

**[Angle Mockups][3]**by none other than the incredible Meng To.  Kicking myself as I could have bought it as a bundle with Design Code, but I bought Design Code 5 days too early! It's like the time when you buy a beautiful coat and after a few days, it goes on sale if bought with an equally amazing pair of shoes.  Nevertheless, it's still an amazing resource that I wouldn't hesitate buying!

**[Magic Mirror ][4]**- it's serious magic. It's the fairy godmother of my mockup life as I build my design portfolio on my new website.
