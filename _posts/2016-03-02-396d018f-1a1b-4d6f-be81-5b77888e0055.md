**Adorable Flat Workspace** - super-cute workspace illustration to brighten up anyone's day! Also a good inspiration for an upcoming project.

**Angle Mockups** by none other than the incredible Meng To.  Kicking myself as I could have bought it as a bundle with Design Code, but I bought Design Code 5 days too early! It's like the time when you buy a beautiful coat and after a few days, it goes on sale if bought with an equally amazing pair of shoes.

**Magic Mirror** - it's serious magic. It's the fairy godmother of my mockup life as I build my design portfolio on my new website.
