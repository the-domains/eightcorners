# There are only two emotions: love and fear.

"There are only two emotions: love and fear.

All positive emotions come from love, all negative emotions from fear.   
From love flows happiness, contentment, peace, and joy.

From fear comes anger, hate, anxiety and guilt.

It's true that there are only two primary emotions, love and fear.

But it's more accurate to say that there is only love or fear, for we cannot feel these two emotions together, at exactly the same time. They're opposites.

If we're in fear, we are not in a place of love.

When we're in a place of love, we cannot be in a place of fear."

― Elisabeth Kübler-Ross
