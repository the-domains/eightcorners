From the time that I learned how to read, it's been one of my favourite things to do. I read everything I could get my hands on.

There are those that take you places and tickle the imagination. The best reads for me are those that move, illuminate, and inspire.

Here are my favourite books, people, and places that help me in staying hungry and living the best life that I can live, so one day I might join someone else's list of inspiring people. Ha. Dreaming is also encouraged, so why not, right?

Anyway, without further ado, here they are (in no particular order):

# Top Inspirational Books

## [Steve Jobs][0] by Walter Isaacson

This is probably the one book that inspired me to follow my heart. I've been obsessed about Steve Jobs ever since I saw this[Bloomberg documentary][1]about him.

Perhaps I was drawn to him him more than I have any other successful person because 1) my birth mother left when I was very young, 2) he reminds me of my dearest uncle who believed in me, and like Steve Jobs, he passed away at a very young age, and 3) I'm an Apple fan girl from the time my dad gave me my very first iPod, and that time when I was at a Singapore IT show, lost with all the PC choices, when I happened upon the Mac stall that just gave me three choices: pro, black or white Macbook? I was in love.

Nevertheless, Apple fan or not, there are very few people who will disagree that Steve Jobs is one of the geniuses of our time.

## [The Four-Hour Work Week][2]by Tim Ferris

Tim Ferriss is like the Napoleon Hill of our time. I love that he is able to live so many lives because he thinks differently from everyone else.

I also love listening to his podcast. The number of insights and ideas you get from him is mind-blowing.

I have to admit, it's taking me ages to finish this book as there's just so much information and it triggers so many ideas that it's hard to stop and focus. But you do, have to stop and focus, if you ever want to go anywhere.

# Top Inspirational Blogs

## [The Middle Finger Project][3]by Ash Ambirge

Typography, copywriting, and attitude. Love, love, love. I could spend days reading Ash Ambirge's blog. It's sooo authentic and real. She inspires me to write more and to just be myself.

## [Sivers.org][4] by Derek Sivers

Derek is simply who I want to be when he grows up. Prolific and so wise, and he's not even that much older than I am. I also spend countless hours on his blog, teachings, directives, and his episode on Tim Ferriss's podcast is phenomenal.

If you need to find clarity in such a noisy world, check out his blog. This is where I hide out.

# Top Inspirational Youtube Videos

## [Steve Jobs' 2005 Stanford Commencement Address][5]

This video is life-changing. If it doesn't inspire you to follow your passion, I don't know what will.

## [J.K. Rowling Speaks at Harvard Commencement][6]

## [Elizabeth Gilbert: Flight of the Hummingbird -- The Curiosity Driven Life][7]
