If you're looking to learn more about design and copywriting, this is one of the best courses out there. From one of my FAVOURITE people on the Internet (Ash Ambirge, The Middle Finger Project), with a designer that has worked with some BIG names (Marie Forleo, Chris Guillebeau, Penguin Books, etc.). 

Last chance to grab the DIY version at this price before it disappears on 17th May 2016\. (The next version will be 2-3x the price! )
