# Renew. Rebrand.

Now that The Grid is out, it's time to rebuild both my blog and [portfolio][0].

After a few years of trial and error, I've finally found my one BIG thing: design. 

It feels scary, exciting, and liberating.

Now that I have found my one focus, it's only fitting to make sure that everything is aligned.

Let's start with this blog and my [portfolio][0] site, where they will be merged into one, since they both represent me.

I'll still have lifestyle and travel articles, with a smattering of design thinking and everything that inspires me. You will see inspiring articles, the things that move me.

It's time that I step away from the wallpaper (like one of those trendy faux-brick ones that look so real that's going to be my next home improvement project). 

This time I will be baring more of my soul, the real me. Because I got to know her a bit more in the past few years, and she's got some pretty cool stories that need to be told. ;-)
