Places we saw and food we ate as we explored New York like locals.

How they put artichokes in pizza and managed to make it so addicting...instead of weird.

How it always looks so cool in black and white. ;) 

How Coney Island that day we went was full of Jews in their beautiful black hats (shtreimel and kippahs) and coats as they celebrated passover with their families at Luna Park. 

How we walked down to Brighton Beach and the entire scenery changed to locals, of Russian and...Chinese descent, and we were the only tourists. 

It's the variety of sights, sounds, and cultures. 

And most of all, how New York always, without fail, remind me of the American dream. 

Of possibilities.
