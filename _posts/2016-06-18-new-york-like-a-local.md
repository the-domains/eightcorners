It's not about the tourist traps. It's about all the following things that locals love about it:

How they put artichokes in pizza and managed to make it so addicting...instead of weird.

How unlike other old and dirty subway stations in other cities, I don't cringe as I'm reminded of its history and the immigrants that helped build it.

How Brooklyn feels so hip and upmarket.

The beautiful brownstones and their front steps.

How it always looks so cool in black and white. ;)

How Coney Island that day we went was full of Jews in their beautiful black hats (shtreimel and kippahs) and coats as they celebrated passover with their families at Luna Park.

How we walked down to Brighton Beach and the entire scenery changed to locals, of Russian and...Chinese descent, and we were the only tourists.

It's the variety of sights, sounds, and cultures.

And most of all, how New York always, without fail, remind me of the American dream.

Of possibilities.
