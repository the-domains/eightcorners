Whether in business or personal life, one of the biggest problems that we face is how to say no. In such a noisy world with so many things happening, we have the tendency to not want to miss out, and so the word NO becomes almost hard to pronounce. As young kids, we were taught to be nice, but somehow, someone forgot to tell us to first be nice to ourselves, then be nice to others.

I ran into this problem a while ago with a publication calling me on behalf of the police. They appealed to my wanting to be part of a community. To help out. When I said yes, the next thing I knew, the same publication calls me about another cause. And then another. At some point, for a small business like myself, I realised that there can only be so much causes I can support. I also realise now why even celebrities only choose one philanthropic cause. You only have so much resources (be it time or money) that while it's sooo hard to say no at the time, you will end up feeling much better in the long run. And everyone will be happier, because when you say yes, you later might end up resenting that you said yes, and that ends up worse than when you said no in the first place.

One of the best phrases I learned from Oprah was this: "I'm sorry, no, I am not able to do that..."

Sometimes you may not be able to say the same exact phrase to a client. So I will leave you with one of my best business role models: the inimitable Ash Ambirge of The Middle Finger Project. Here are my favourite articles from her on how to say no (yes, we are not alone on this!). Trust me, you will want to read these. She writes like no other, and her business advice will also make you laugh and smile and cry all at once.
