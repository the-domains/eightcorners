## Design Digest: Week 11

# Design Hacks for Your Business

Hello, everyone. I know, I missed Week 10, but here are some juicy new links for you that will totally make up for my being AWOL.

This week's theme is sizes. Size is crazy important...if you catch my drift. ;) Be it getting the right size for your clothes, shoes, your wine glass, etc.

As much as we love the digital world, size, while it's important, has also become an issue. It's pretty much complicated so many things! For a designer, this is a pain. I'm sure it has been for you as well.

Anyway, so let's talk about our size problems. \*wink\*

You know when you want to create social media posts? You'd usually just use squares because they work across all platforms, because honestly, who has the time to create five for each graphic? You'll have to resize it, move the heading, or the button, etc. And don't even get me started on watermarks and logos!

Well, let me introduce you to:

You're very welcome, and thank you for your forgiveness. :D

Now the next problem:

How do you make sure that your website is responsive across all screen sizes?

Just put in your website and voila!

And what about fonts? All your font sizes are all over the place, and you're not sure what sizes are best!

Well, let a smart computer calculate it for you at:

Hint: use _ems_ for the best responsive experience.

What about finding a website and you want to find out what size fonts and typefaces they're using? Forget What The Font.

Here ya go! [http://www.fontface.ninja/][3]

That's all I've got for you, folks.
