![Tips & tricks that we used to maximise our frequent flyer miles earnings.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b7c76efe-786f-4a7e-bbbe-72d085334550.jpg)

In my last post, I wrote about our [once-in-a-lifetime suite class flight experience with Singapore Airlines][0].

Our two Suite Class return tickets from Singapore to New York were all from the miles we've earned over the years. And you can totally do the same!

Here are our top tips on optimising your miles earnings:

1. **Get the highest miles-earning credit card you can get**, or your favourite airline. Do some research about local credit card points and choose the one that can give you more airline miles (note: not points. Dollars convert to points, then to miles) for your dollar (or other currency unit). In our case, this is the Singapore Airlines Platinum American Express card with Westpac. Sure, we pay almost $300/year membership fee, but the rewards are so much more. Then don't forget to sign up for a frequent flyer miles account with your chosen airline.
2. **Never spend cash. **Pay with card as much as you can, like coffee, bills, groceries, everything! Just be sure to hang on to your cash and pay it all off before the due date to avoid getting slammed with interest charges.
3. **Pay your rent with your credit card**, if you can. If you're in Australia, you probably pay an average of $20,000/year in rent. That's a LOT of miles. If your landlord doesn't accept it, there are services that do this for a fee. In our case, we signed up with [Rental Rewards][1]. [https://www.rentalrewards.com.au/][1] If you're not from Australia, just Google: \[your country/city\] + pay rent with credit card
4. **Pay for your group meals and activities,** then get your friends to pay you back in cash. We can't do this anymore, because they're onto us and they know what we're up to. (Thanks for the flights, guys! You know who you are. XO ;P)
5. **Research the partner services **that give you the highest frequent flyer points/rewards. In our case, car rental with Hertz (since we chose not to own a car) and hotels.
6. **Fly frequently!** Obviously, since it's called frequent flyer miles. ;-) But be sure to fly with your chosen airline or a partner airline that can transfer the miles.
7. **Focus on one frequent flyer miles program. **We've seen some people with a bunch of frequent flyer points everywhere, but unless you can transfer them to one (which is not very common), you can't even use them for one return flight. So choose wisely and focus your efforts on the chosen one.

If you're always mindful about earning miles with every dollar you spend, in just a few years, you should have enough miles to fly first class halfway around the world! Or a bunch of economy flights, your choice! :)
