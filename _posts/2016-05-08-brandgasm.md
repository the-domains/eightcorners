If you're looking to learn more about design and copywriting, this is one of the best courses out there. From one of my FAVOURITE people on the Internet, with a designer that has worked with some BIG names.

Last chance to grab this DIY course before it disappears next Tuesday, 17th May 2016! (The next version will be live and at a much higher price.)
