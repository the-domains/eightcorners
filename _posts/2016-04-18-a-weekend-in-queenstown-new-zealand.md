# A Weekend in Queenstown, New Zealand

In December, we had these free Jetstar tickets to use that were about to expire at the end of the year. We could use the free tickets to just about any destination in the Jetstar network, so we looked for places that was far enough to maximise the ticket value, but not too far that we lose so much time in the air. We only had one weekend to spare after having just come back from a big trip. It is at this point that we decided to go to Queenstown, NZ.

## The Southern Alps

On the way to Queenstown, we flew over the Southern Alps. It was breathtakingly serene and peaceful, unadulterated and pristine. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b2259d6d-f780-400e-b92b-a664cfb18d8c.jpg)

## Devil's Staircase

Coming into immigrations, we had to explain the reason why we were only staying one night. I guess everyone stays there a lot longer. I could understand why: our first stop was Devil's Staircase on Wye Creek. We walked down to the banks, marvelled at the smooth, flat rocks, and lay there soaking up the warm sunshine. There were only two other couples there. It was so quiet and peaceful, that we ended up getting comfortable on the rocks and napping for two hours. It was bliss.

## Romantic Dinner at the Waterfront

Next, we wandered around the little town and had a nice dinner at the waterfront.

## Yoga & Wellbeing

We then checked into Sherwood which was an environmentally-friendly hotel/lodge with a modern, upmarket bar and a full-fledged yoga studio. I can totally imagine staying there again on a yoga retreat or a ski holiday.

## Arrowtown Chinese Settlement

The next day, we headed to the Arrowtown Chinese Settlement. It looked like Hobbiton with little huts, albeit with a very sad history.

The rest of Arrowtown felt like a little fairytale village with candy shops and old signboards. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/44b8a7e7-2213-461c-8e24-965fdb7c469e.jpg)

## The Fergburger

It was time to head get ready for our flight. I craved the burgers at Fergburger that I kept reading about, but we didn't have time. Arriving at the airport, we found out that our flight was delayed by two hours. We had time after all. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/221c9ca4-1fec-4eb8-8598-afb76fbcbd59.jpg)

And it was totally worth the trip back to town. It was meant to be.
