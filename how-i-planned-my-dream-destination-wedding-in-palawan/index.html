<p>Planning your dream destination wedding can be daunting—I had to do months of research when I was planning mine, and I had trouble finding a definitive guide that would have saved me time doing all the research.</p><p>Since our wedding was going to be small and intimate, I decided to plan our wedding myself. If you have a demanding full-time job, I would advise against this, or at least try and outsource some tasks to a bridesmaid or hire a virtual assistant to at least answer your guests’ questions.</p><p>Looking back, this is the only thing I would have done differently—it would have saved me a lot of stress and I would have looked less tired in the photos and I would have been able to relax a bit more. Nevertheless, we had an amazing wedding and I wouldn’t change anything else.</p><p>I write this guide in the hope that it helps brides (or grooms) out there plan their perfect destination beach wedding.</p><p>Wedding planners I would have hired:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.colincowie.com/">Colin Cowie</a> – according to Buzz Sumo, photos of the weddings he’s planned are one of the top ones on Pinterest, and looking at his website, I can see why!</li><li><a href="http://my.cebuboholweddings.com/">January Tan</a> – award-winning wedding planner, specialising in Cebu/Philippine weddings</li></ul><p>I write this little guide in the hope that it helps brides out there plan their perfect wedding.</p><p><i>Destination beach wedding in Palawan, Philippines. Photo by Julian Abram Wainwright</i></p><p>Weddings these days don’t have to be an expensive affair; even a dream destination beach wedding like ours cost less than what it would have cost having a beach wedding in Australia. I suppose the Internet democratises that like everything else—it’s so much easier to find wedding venues and providers without having to hire a wedding planner.</p><p>As I mentioned before, looking back, I would have still hired a wedding planner (see appendix for recommendations) because having a full-time job and at the same time planning a wedding is not for the faint-hearted. It gets stressful even for someone as laid-back as I am. I am ashamed to admit that there have been a few inescapable bridezilla moments as a consequence.</p><p>What helped immensely was that we had a budget and a vision of an intimate beach wedding, with very select friends and family around us, to which luckily, the groom and our families didn’t have many objections.</p><p>However, this may not be the case for everyone, as I have seen with some friends and distant relatives. There will be some superstitions, traditions, and different cultures that you may need to take into account, and it will be entirely dependent on how flexible or adaptable everyone else involved would be.</p><p>In order to keep the peace, remember to pick your own battles, as the age-old wisdom goes. If you find yourself debating whether or not you should invite a certain cousin or having another item added to your menu because it’s tradition, always ask yourself if it’s worth the hassle to resist or to just let it go. You will also probably find yourself making numerous decisions such as these, both in planning the wedding and throughout your wedded life.</p><p>I don’t mean that you should become a doormat on your own wedding (least of all your marriage), but rather, choose the top five or ten things that you are going to stand your ground on. As for the rest, try to just let it flow, or maybe ask your groom or bride to make the decisions for you.</p><p>I read somewhere that US President Obama lets others decide what he should have for dinner, because he wants to save his decision-making energy on larger matters. Decision fatigue is real, and it’s perfectly alright to delegate.</p><p>No matter how stressful it gets, remember that your wedding is a celebration of love between you and your chosen partner in life—with everyone else around you that you love as witnesses and supporters of the vows you make on your wedding day.</p><p>Assume that <i>your perfect dream wedding won’t be perfect in reality</i>—then let it go, or have a laugh. As you look back, you’ll realise that in the end, it was perfect even with all the mishaps. As your man or woman isn’t perfect, yet he or she is perfect for you—the same concept applies to your wedding, and later on, your marriage.</p><p>This is the most important thing to keep in mind—it will help keep your sanity and keep you from turning into a bridezilla or groomzilla. It will be tough, but if you can do it, it will be worth it.</p><p><b>How To Plan A Dream Destination Beach Wedding</b></p><p>CHOOSING THE DESTINATION</p><p>Every girl, even a tomboy like me, probably had a dream wedding in mind from her teenage years. This was the case with me—I even knew I wanted to get married in Palawan, Philippines. Despite never having set foot in Palawan at the time, I fell in love when I saw pictures of azure blue waters, emerald-green foliage, and pristine islands dotted with native huts. I fell head over heels with Palawan and there was no looking back.</p><p>This may be the case for you, or not; if you don’t have a location in mind, or you’ve already chosen a date, then I would suggest moving on to the next section because this will be a huge factor in choosing the location, or more specifically, the venue.</p><p> CHOOSING YOUR WEDDING DATE</p><p>Since we already had a destination in mind for our beach wedding, we picked a date based on the following factors:</p><p><b>Ideal weather</b>—in our case, we picked a date where there would be less probability of storms/typhoons/monsoon (for obvious reasons). Unless your ideal wedding is a rain-soaked one a la the movie <i>About Time</i> (which can be cute), then the weather is a critical factor. In most cases, the dream is a classic wedding at sunset, surrounded by loved ones, and the only things that are not dry are their eyes.</p><p><b>Availability of guests</b>—what would be an ideal time or season for your guests? E.g., if most of your guests are accountants, it might be best to avoid the tax season or year-end financials.</p><p><b>Ideal temperature</b>—some destinations can have different temperatures year-round—choose a season that’s not unbearably hot or cold.</p><p><b>Availability of venue</b>—if you have a venue in mind that you <i>really</i> love, then this could be the deciding factor on choosing your wedding date.</p><p>Other factors to consider for a destination beach wedding</p><p><b>Auspicious Date</b>—this is more applicable to Chinese/Asians or any other beliefs or factors you or your relatives might have. In some cases, this can be the biggest factor.</p><p><b>Budget</b>—if you have a venue that you absolutely love but it’s a little over the budget, choosing a date during the low season could give you a bit more bargaining power.</p><p><b>Peak Season</b>—it is recommended to avoid the peak season if you want to have a more intimate wedding (unless you can have exclusive, private use of the facilities or a specified section of the venue).</p><p><b>Legals</b>—this could be a crucial one as some countries have complicated requirements for getting your marriage license. As an example, getting a marriage license in the Philippines can take several weeks. We decided that it was easier to register our marriage in Melbourne prior to our beach wedding ceremony. A couple of friends did the same: registry in Melbourne followed by an overseas ceremony.</p><p>IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A DATE</p><p>Some couples may have already decided on the date. If the date is the biggest factor for you, you can then move to the next stage and begin to narrow down the venue.</p><p><b>THE HOLIDAYS</b></p><p>We chose the month of December—closer to Christmas so that our friends could just apply for annual leave in addition to their Christmas holidays. For some, this may not be ideal if they always spend Christmas with family.</p><p>Since our closest friends are expats and quite used to spending Christmas away from home and their families, this seemed like the best date for us. December is also out of the monsoon season, and the weather is mild—it seemed like the best choice.</p><p>One caveat to choosing the Christmas holidays is that the flights and the airports are going to be very busy, so be sure to book your flights early.</p><p>FLIGHT BOOKINGS</p><p>Book your flights with at least a one-day buffer for each leg, based on worst-case scenarios or, at least, the assumption that you will miss each leg of each flight. In our case, we had two legs in our journey: Melbourne-Manila then Manila-Busuanga (Palawan). On the first international leg, we flew with Philippine Airlines, which had several flights a week (Plan B being taking a Qantas flight), then Cebu Pacific on the domestic flight which had several flights a day.</p><p>Some destinations may only fly once a day or once a week—if this were the case, consider booking one week in advance or prepare a Plan B (travel by land/sea, etc.).</p><p><i>Destination beach wedding in Palawan, Philippines. Photo by Julian Abram Wainwright</i></p><p>FINDING A VENUE</p><p><b>Finding the right venue and photographer</b> are the toughest—and the most integral—parts to planning your dream destination beach wedding<b>.</b> For this reason, a large chunk of our budget was allocated to the venue, and my first choice of venue was unable to work with our budget, despite numerous emails back and forth.</p><p>Neither my second nor third choices even come close to the budget, no matter how hard I bargained. What was quite surprising, however, was that on the whole, the more exclusive first choice ended up being on par if not cheaper than the others.</p><p>Don’t be afraid to ask about discounts (in the nicest way possible, because you wouldn’t want to come off as a stingy bridezilla), even if the resort looks way over your budget (just be careful not to go their way!). It doesn’t hurt, and if you’re lucky, you might get a yes!</p><p>In finding a venue, we had the following considerations:</p><p><b>Logistics</b>—since we didn’t get a wedding planner, we wanted a venue that could do everything: ceremony, reception, transport, and accommodations. This way, we didn’t have to worry about transporting guests between locations and coordinating vendors.</p><p><b>Accessibility</b>—how much travel/transfers can you and your guests do?</p><p><b>Exclusivity</b>—we didn’t want a big place which would likely get really crowded, especially since we picked a peak season date.</p><p><b>Rating</b>—the food, service and accommodations had to be top-notch or best value.</p><p><b>Facilities</b>—if you want a beach wedding, make sure you can get married on the beach! Usually, the resorts will have already done a few, so just ask them about this if they don’t already have the information on their website.</p><p><b>Budget</b>—an all-inclusive package makes things simpler. If it’s not available, consider the cost of chartered flights, accommodations, food, and beverages.</p><p><b>Flexibility</b>—in terms of noise levels, corkage, special requests, etc. Some places can be quite strict; some can be accommodating.</p><p><b>Theme</b>—I imagined a simple, laid-back, natural theme so we narrowed it down to boutique resorts rather than the bigger ones.</p><p><b>Capacity</b>—does the resort have capacity to accommodate you and your guests? Are there any other resorts nearby that can accommodate the overflow?</p><p>The Ideal Venue</p><p>It would be nearly impossible to find the perfect one that would fit all the requirements, especially with a small budget like ours, but it’s possible.</p><p>Choose the factors that are most important to you—the deal-breakers—then work with that. We were lucky to have found a place that ticked all the boxes, but it wasn’t easy to find.</p><p>After months of searching and I was about to give up, we found the dream venue. It was even better than anything we had ever imagined: we managed to booked <i>an entire island</i> for a much better overall package and well within budget as opposed to the first choice luxury resort.</p><p>And how do you know if it’s the right venue? Just like the moment you knew your future spouse is the one, <i>you’ll know</i>. If a resort is difficult to work with from the beginning, then you can be sure that this won’t get any easier.</p><p>So keep looking—the perfect venue is out there for you. Don’t give up!</p><p><i>Destination beach wedding in Palawan, Philippines.
