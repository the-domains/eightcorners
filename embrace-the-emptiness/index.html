So many things are wanting our attention.</p><p>And sometimes, we drown out the things seeking our attention with even more noise. (Or when you spray perfume in your hair because you didn't have time to wash it—deep down, you know it still really reeks and you hope no one would get closer.)</p><p>Perhaps like me, you grew up in a very tumultuous environment. Maybe not as traumatising as being abused as a child (and I can NOT even begin to imagine this), but it can still affect you in so many ways.</p><p>(This reminds me of the conversation between</p><p><a data-mce-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E94l1KGC24E" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E94l1KGC24E">Sheldon and Penny in Big Bang Theory</a></p><p>where they tried to bond by sharing personal revelations: something personal that really mattered to them, that they haven't told anyone else. Penny shared her embarrassment over a movie she starred topless in. Sheldon revealed that he was never really okay with Youtube changing their rating system from stars to thumbs up/down, but he never admitted it to anyone. On the surface level, Sheldon's revelation seemed more trivial. Yet to each of them, if you somehow scientifically measure the levels of emotion, they could be suffering the same level of pain. Which reminds us to never judge other people's sufferings, and how important it is to empathise.)</p><p>Recently, as many of my friends and family know, I have been in search of my own truth. After years of drowning in noise and serving others so that I can safely ignore my own needs, as somehow I grew up thinking they were not important, I've come to this point.</p><p>I've done meditation, and I've used it to focus and drown out noise around me so I can focus on writing, for instance.

Maybe it's creating a new app. Or starting a design practice. Or writing a blog. Or writing a book on destination weddings. Joining a training course. Or spending too much time on Facebook..."networking".</p><p>Yet at some stage, it felt like I was going down that rabbit hole again. If you're not listening to yourself, and you're not present, that's when it all gets confusing. </p><p>When it all gets confusing, you need to step back, retreat, reevaluate, reboot.</p><p>And listen. Don't listen to just anything or anyone else. Just listen to yourself.</p><p>And the only way to listen to yourself is to embrace the emptiness. Close that Facebook tab...or log out, if you dare. Disable your wifi. Listen.</p><p>We've been conditioned to think empty is bad, especially during the reign of extroverts. That it's lonely. Yet it's only lonely if you don't think you deserve to hear yourself. (And I don't mean this in a creepy way, especially if you're hearing a voice with an evil laugh like Cruella De Vil's—but even then I'm pretty sure your real self will tell you something's wrong and that maybe you need to talk to someone first. ;P )</p><p>And the only way to hear you is to first empty yourself of the noise so that you could hear yourself better. Much like an empty room - this is the place when you can hear your own footsteps...your breathing...your heartbeat...your heart.</p><p>So many of us are doing so many things to be heard. To be validated.</p><p>Yet there's really only one opinion and validation that matters (which ironically, tends to get ignored): yours. </p><p>And ask yourself this (one of my favourite quotes of all time, from Steve Jobs): </p><p>"'If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?' And whenever the answer has been 'no' for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something. "</p><p>If you can't figure out what to change? Stay still. Going on Facebook won't help.</p><p>Write down your thoughts. If you're just hearing crickets, read a book, or listen to a favourite podcast that makes you think. </p><p>Find inspiration...but be wary of distractions.</p><p>Throw out the excess baggage that's weighing you down. Maybe you'll think to yourself, "It was interesting to hear that people are winning at Periscope, but it's not for me. Is that you, fear? Nope, it's...just...me. It just doesn't feel right. But what feels right? Pinterest, that sounds a lot more like me.". Or, "I've been working on this project for so long that it feels weird to leave it, but it really doesn't seem like this is what I want to do nor is it going to take me closer to my goals."</p><p>Then maybe you'll realise that, ok, it all makes sense again. I'm on the right path. I just need to adjust my course a little. Or perhaps you might think, oops, I think I'm going the wrong way. And that's okay. It's better that you figured this one out sooner than later.</p><p>Because sometimes, the things that keep us moving forward are our own thoughts and truths that we choose to ignore.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="22"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="24"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="25"><span data-reactid="26"><!-- react-empty: 27 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="28"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="29">Embrace The Emptiness</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="30"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="32"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
